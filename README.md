# BrewProject
Brewing system using Arduino
As a brewer for Brasserie de la Violette in Switzerland, I wanted to acquire a 20 Liter brewing equipment for small scale brewing tests. I would like an automatic system, convenient to handle, and allowing a good batch to batch reproducibility.
Two option:s
-	Buying an all included, automatic and expensive brewing equipment as Barumeister, Grainfather, Brewmonk, or
-	Customizing my old Brewferm electric kettle like a brewing Maserati
I choose the second option, coding by myself and learning by doing. I decided to start this project using Arduino as it is an easy-to-use micro controller board. Laguage C++ is easy to write and tutorials are available to code and use the components.
